Lets see what we can do.
```
./downtime.py -h
```
Will output the above help text. By the way the only command that does not need authentication.
```
./downtime.py -u <automation> -p <secret> -i -o list
```
Will list all scheduled downtimes.
```
./downtime.py -u <automation> -p <secret> -c "Downtime for maintenance" -o list
```
Will show all scheduled downtimes with the passed comment.
```
./downtime.py -u <automation> -p <secret> -c "Downtime for maintenance" -o remove
```
Will remove all the scheduled downtimes with the given comment. That said, the comment can be used as a kind of key.
```
./downtime.py -u <automation> -p <secret> -c "Maintenance ID:002324 -S <servicegroup> -B 2019-06-23 -b 12:00 -E 2019-06-25 -e 12:00 -o add
```
Will add a downtime for a servicegroup for two days beginning at June 23 2019 12:00 PM and ending at June 25 2019 12:00 PM.
```
./downtime.py -u <automation> -p <secret> -c "Maintenance ID:002324 -S <servicegroup> -o remove
```
Will remove the downtime set before.

TODO:
 - [ ] There should be a CLI argument to list the downtimes in human readable fashion
 - [ ] The classes are just 'containers' that store data. It would make more sense to make them iterable.
 - [ ] The setup of the logging facility has been realised by calling a function. This is kind of ugly. Nice would be a reference to the logging facility (Has a)
 - [ ] It should be possible to only allow downtimes for hosts and services where the user is permitted. (How to pass the user credentials without exposing them to all others)
 - [ ] Rethink the architecture of the model (I'm not happy)
 - [ ] Make the comments python like
 - [ ] Implement unit tests
 - [ ] Combine livestatus queries instead of querying every single host or service
  
Since I'm not really familiar with python, I still learning, I highly appreciate any input that helps me to improve my skills.
